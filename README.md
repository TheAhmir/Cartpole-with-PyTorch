# Cartpole-with-PyTorch

<<<<<<< HEAD
This project aims to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm using PyTorch to solve the Cartpole environment from OpenAI Gym. This serves as an introductory project to reinforcement learning with PyTorch.

## Introduction

Cartpole is a classic reinforcement learning problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart by moving the cart left or right. The environment provides observations about the state of the system and allows actions to be taken to control the cart. The goal is to keep the pole balanced for as long as possible.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cartpole-with-PyTorch.git
=======
This is my First time using pytorch. Cartpole is an ai environment I'm using from openai gym to start learning about reinforcement algorithms in pytorch for future projects.
